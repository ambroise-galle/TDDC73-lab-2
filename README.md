# Lab 2

## Task

Create your own version of the application shown below using one of the frameworks from Lab 1.
Additional instructions:

The logo of the card must change according to the current card number input, see the linked executable version for an example
Validate user input when appropriate, for example on numeric fields and maximum input length
Similar to the example, "#"-symbols should be used as placeholders in the card number (note that American Express uses a different card number format)
The card element and form element of the interface should partly overlap, as in the example
Implement at least one animation in your user interface (you do not need to include all animations shown in the example)
User interface 2

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
